    <p>On 16 August 2018, severe <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood" target="_blank"> floods <a/>affected the south Indian state Kerala, due to unusually high rainfall during the monsoon season. It was the worst flood in Kerala in nearly a century.Over 483 people died, and 15 are missing. About a million people About a million people were evacuated, mainly from <i>Chengannur,Pandanad, Edanad, Aranmula, Kozhencherry, Ayiroor, Ranni, Pandalam, Kuttanad, Malappuram, Aluva, Chalakudy, Thrissur, Thiruvalla, Eraviperoor, Vallamkulam, North Paravur, Chellanam, Vypin Island</i> and <i>Palakkad</i>. All 14 districts of the state were placed on red alert. According to the Kerala government, one-sixth of the total population of Kerala had been directly affected by the floods and related incidents. The Indian government had declared it a Level 3 Calamity, or "calamity of a severe nature". It is the worst flood in Kerala after the great flood of 99 that took place in 1924.</p>
    <p>With the recurrence of flood events in the state in the subsequent years, several studies which ensued explain the manifestation of westwardpropagating high frequency tropical atmospheric waves of characteristic phase speed of nearly 12m/s, which originated near east equatorial <a href="indian ocean.html"> Indian Ocean </a>or tropical West Pacific and travelled to the east coast of Africa, and coincide with the same period of extreme rainfall events over Kerala. Moreover, the waves appeared as cyclonic and anti-cyclonic circulations trapped to the equator, which dilated the wind field and transported moisture as it propagated. The waves not only stimulated convection along its trajectory, but also ensured sufficient moisture availability. Therefore, the convective activities which intensified in the mid-troposphere, were the direct consequence of the equatorially-trapped high frequency waves, which played a significant role in driving the recurrent anomalous precipitation in the South Indian state.</p>
